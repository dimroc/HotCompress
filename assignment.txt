Assignment: Build a Hosted URL Shortener Service
Due: 6/30 at the latest

A URL shortener service allows users to create short redirect URLs from very long URLs. 
For example, Bit.ly will shorten https://github.com/generalassembly/ga-ruby-on-rails-for-devs as http://bit.ly/whjfQ0.

	The minimal set of features is:
Done	1. An anonymous user should be able to shorten a URL by entering it on the site. 
			Using this URL redirects the browser to the destination URL. 

Done		2. Users can register and shorten URLs. Registered users can see all the URLs they have shortened.

Done	3. Users can see a page with the number of times someone has used their short URLs, most popular URL first. 

Done	4. The site has a public page with the number of times someone has used any of the short URLs, most popular URL first.

		5. The implementation must be Ruby on Rails, be committed to Github and the service has to run on Heroku.
