Mongo

threaded
dynamic tables
padded columns
stored procedures
cache
queue
joins on warmup
huge schema
orm madness

CAP triangle
-consistency - the data looks the same to all clients
-availability - each client can read/write at any time
-partition tolerance - system works through distribution issues - i.e. loss of servers/connections/etc

Have to pick two of the above for a distributed system

Star schema - expensive
